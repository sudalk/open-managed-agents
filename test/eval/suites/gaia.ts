 *   1. Request access at https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaia-benchmark/GAIA
 *   2. HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx ./scripts/fetch-gaia.sh
 *   3. (creates test/eval/data/gaia-validation.jsonl)

 * Without the file present, the suite falls back to a tiny set of
 * paper-public examples so the pipeline can be demoed end-to-end.
