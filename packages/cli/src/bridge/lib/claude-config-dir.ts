/**
 * Build a per-session `.claude-config/` directory the spawned Claude Code
 * child reads via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<cwd>/.claude-config`. Lets us hide
 * specific local skills from a given OMA agent without touching the user's
 * real `~/.claude/`.
 *
 * Strategy: symlink everything from `~/.claude/` over EXCEPT the skills tree,
 * then rebuild `skills/` filtering out any id present in the blocklist.
 *
 *   ~/.claude/                  →   <cwd>/.claude-config/
 *     settings.json             →     settings.json (symlink)
 *     credentials.json          →     credentials.json (symlink)
 *     agents/                   →     agents/ (symlink)
 *     commands/                 →     commands/ (symlink)
 *     plugins/                  →     plugins/ (symlink, atomic)
 *     ...                       →     ... (symlink, atomic)
 *     skills/<id>/              →     skills/<id>/ (symlink, only if NOT blocklisted)
 *
 * Blocklist is a Set of skill ids (the bare directory name). v1 filters only
 * `~/.claude/skills/<id>/` — the common case where users drop custom skills
 * by hand. Plugin-bundled skills come along with the wholesale `plugins/`
 * symlink and aren't filterable yet (their layout is
 * `plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<ver>/skills/<id>/` — would need a
 * recursive walk to filter individually). Add when a real user hits this.
 *
 * For non–claude-agent-acp agents this isn't called; their skill ecosystems
 * don't share Claude Code's filesystem layout. Add per-agent helpers when
 * codex / opencode / gemini grow analogous mechanisms.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: a missing source dir, a stale symlink left over
 * from a previous spawn, or a permission error on one entry must not abort
 * the spawn — we log and keep going. Worst case the child sees a stale
 * `.claude-config/` from the previous turn, which is still safer than
 * crashing the daemon between user prompts.
