// Cloudflare-specific adapters that implement integrations-core ports against
// D1, KV, service bindings, Web Crypto, and the Workers fetch API.
//
// Consumed by apps/integrations' composition root. Provider packages never
// depend on this — they receive port instances as constructor arguments.
