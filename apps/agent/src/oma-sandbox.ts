// OMA Sandbox subclass — wires the @cloudflare/sandbox 0.8.x outbound
// handler API so vault credentials get injected into outbound requests
// (e.g. Bearer header for MCP server calls). The handler is bound at
// runtime via `sandbox.setOutboundHandler("inject_vault_creds", { ... })`
// — see apps/agent/src/runtime/session-do.ts for where that fires.
//
// Architectural property (mirrors Anthropic Managed Agents' "credential
// proxy outside the harness" pattern): this handler runs in the agent
// worker process, but it does NOT receive plaintext vault credentials in
// its `ctx.params`. The only data passed in is `(tenantId, sessionId)` —
// public identifiers that the model could already see. The actual
// credential lookup and injection happen in main worker via the
// `env.MAIN_MCP.outboundForward` WorkerEntrypoint RPC, where the vault
// data already lives.
//
// Pre-refactor we passed `vault_credentials` directly to setOutboundHandler;
// CF Sandbox SDK then stashed them in container memory. A
// container-escape or prompt-injection-driven RCE could read them out.
// Post-refactor: the agent worker's address space never contains the
// credentials at all. Container compromise can't exfiltrate what the
// container's host process never loaded.
//

/**
 * Headers we strip before forwarding upstream. CF Workers auto-adds some
 * of these when you invoke `fetch()` from a worker; if they're in the
 * upstream's SigV4-signed-headers list (boto3, aws-sdk, s3fs, awscli),
 * the signature mismatch produces a 403. The container's libcurl/sdk
 * never set these — they're CF artifacts of going through our handler.
 *
 * `host` is also problematic: container's libcurl set it to upstream's
 * host; if we forward via `new Request(url, { headers })` the runtime
 * may rewrite based on URL. We trust the runtime's auto-set Host
 * (matches URL) so we strip the explicit one to avoid header collision.
